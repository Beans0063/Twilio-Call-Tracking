Twilio Call Tracking Demo
========================

Call tracking works with the Twilio API, so you'll need an account and phone 
number at Twilio before you can get started. Twilio sells simple, pay as you 
go phone services, and you can sign up for a free account with $30 of free 
credits at [http://www.twilio.com](http://www.twilio.com).

Installation
============

Installation is as simple as copying the folder, making it 
writeable and editing the configuration file.

1. Copy the folder to your server.

2. Make the folder writeable.

3. Edit `/include/config.php`

4. Access via browser `http://yourserver/call_tracking/index.php`

5. You'll need an account at http://www.twilio.com.  Set your Sandbox phone number or purchased number's Voice URL to http://www.yourserver.com/handle_incoming_call.php.  If you have upgraded your Twilio account, you can use this application's UI to configure your numbers.
